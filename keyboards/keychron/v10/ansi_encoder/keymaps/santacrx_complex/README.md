# @santacrx's Keychron V10 Firmware mod
This is my customization for my v10 to maximize the capabilities plus visuals I wanted. 
This keymap has custom lighting per layer based on what the layer contents are. 
This is a spin-off of my original keymap, with a more complex change of states using the knob, thus freeing the key to the right of the rh spacebar for something else.

Basic function coloring is  still kept from `santacrx_layers`, but this is playground for using the knob to change macro and knob functionality without changing the basic keyboard ones. 
I can have different macro layers available for regular typing, one for LabVIEW use, one for Excel & MATLAB/Simulink, one for VSCODE, and one for CAD, plus an extra one as a placeholder for future value. 
I still have the qwerty layer and the numpad/mouse layer.
Also the original OS switch at the back is now mapped to lights on/off. 

I will like to have a VIA customization turned on.
That is the next step. I realized I could do the same behavior with just three layers a bunch of functions re-mapping the Macro Keys based on the global MacroID number.
Might branch and try that to see if there is any performance or bin file size improvement. 
For now, I'll keep this as it's doing what I wanted to.
Also, just bought a V10 Max for home (my wired one being now at work).
Need to figure out if this firmware will work with it.


## Layers
After months of use of `santacrx_layers`, I realized that I was not using the secondary qwerty layer I had.
I also noticed that the funcionalities I wanted on my knob where limited by the setup.
Lastly, I had to sometimes reconfigure my macros in VIA just so I could be producitve that day depending on what I ws going to do. 
This keymap addresses all of the above, by allowing multiple knob and macro configurations based on the software package to be used.
Its build up on using lights to indicate which state/layer we are in so that I can know where we are just by glancing at my keeb.


### Description
The following table described the intended layer functinality.
I made the decision to have 8 layers just beacause its a clean binary number and allows for a future addition without rework.

Layer definition:

| Bit |Status|	Name   |	Keys  |	Macros	|	Knob        |	Lights	|
|:---:|:----:|---------|----------|---------|-----------    |-----------|
|  0  | --   | `_FN`   | --	      | --	    |Change M Layer |Spiral|
| *1* | x02  |*`_BASE`*|*QWERTY*  |*Typing*	|*Side Scroll*  |*Regular*| 
|  2  | x06  | `_LV`   | ↑	      |Labview	| ↑	            |↑+Orange Macros|
|  3  | x0A  | `_DAT`  | ↑ 	      |Data		| ↑	            |↑+Purple Macros|
|  4  | x12  | `_VS`   | ↑ 	      |Code		|L/R Arrow	    |↑+Red Macros|
|  5  | x22  | `_CAD`  | ↑ 	      |Onshape	|Volume	        |↑+Green Macros|
|  6  | x42  |	`_NA`  | ↑	      | --	    |Music	        |↑+Pink			|
|  7  | --   | `_NUM`  |NUM+MOUSE | --    	|U/D Wheel	    |Party|

### Layout
The overall layout is as follows, based on the tabulated description above (showing `_CAD` overlay active on top of `_BASE`):

```
Overlay feature layer
---------------------      bit|status
       ____________        ---+------
      /           /           |
   7 /___________/_         7 |   0
      /           /           |    
   6 /___________//         6 |   0
   5 /___________// ----->  5 |   1
   4 /___________//         4 |   0
   3 /___________//         3 |   0
   2 /___________//         2 |   0
,->1 /___________/_ ----->  1 |   1
|     /           /           |
|  0 /___________/          0 |   0
|                                 +
`--- default_layer = 1            |
     layer_state   = 0x0022 <-----'
```

Layers 0 and 7 will be toggled by the FN and NUM keys respectively.
Layers 1 through 6 are the default and overlays respectively.
The cycle will be 1→0→1, or 1→7→1. 
When in 0, the knob cycles the overlay.
The Macro keys' backlighting will change according to the selected overlay setting.
When returning from 0, the respective overlay will be activated.

## Features and Functionality

### Layer Interface backbone
* Layer 1 *_BASE* set as default in initializing function
* Debugging and console enabled
* Use of `Layer_Move()` for layers 1-6
* Use of custom function for layers 0 *_FN* and 7 *_NUM*

### Functions

* Macro layer selector:
  * CW knob =+1 layer index, CCW =-1. 
  * [Sample](https://docs.qmk.fm/feature_layers#example-keycode-to-cycle-through-layers) used as backbone, create two keys to get that up and down
  * bitwise operations for masking
  * custom functions to go to and get out of layer selection
* Lights
  * Change light setting based on which layer group we are on
  * make the Macro key's background color based on macro layer selected
  * layer selection layer color is based on macro setting (see table above)

### Macros
* Base
  * N tilde
  * Degree symbol
  * Section symbol
  * Mu
* LabVIEW
  * While Loop
  * For Loop
  * Local Variable
  * Global Variable
* Excel/Data
  * Add Row
  * Add Column
* Code
  * Up directory
  * Open CMD in admin mode
* CAD/OnShape
  * Pan modifier
  
### Lights

* Added some RGB_MATRIX modes that were not turned on by default
* Global layer color effects: 
  * Transparent or unsassigned keys have no backlight. 
  * CAPS only has alphas ON
* Each layer has now a visible distinction, besides the stated above:
  * `_NUM` is visibly different than the rest with rainbow pattern. 
  * `_BASE` and above, except `_NUM` 
    * share the same pattern
    * Macro column has different color based on which layer is active
  * `_FN` has diagonal to LH-HI corner (mimicking pointing to knob)
