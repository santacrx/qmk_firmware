# @santacrx's Keychron V10 Firmware mod
This is my customization for my v10 to maximize the capabilities plus visuals I wanted. This keymap attempts to have custom lighting per layer and based on what the layer contents are.

## Features
* 4 layers
  * _Base windows qwerty layer
  * _F1 normal functions
  * _F2 alternate querty and other functions. Mainly a different setting for the knob
  * _Numpad and mouse
* Each layer has its own color scheme, adapted from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/olkb/comments/e0hurb/comment/fawrcem/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
* Added some RGB_MATRIX modes that were not turned on by default

## Worflow / Desired Features / Bugs
